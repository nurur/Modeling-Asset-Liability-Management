Modeling Asset-Liability Management 


This repository contains modeling of Asset-Liability Managment of an insurance 
company using AMPL programing language. While the complete model implemeneted 
in this project represent realistic scenario, I used synthetic data to reproduce 
the results of Yang, X., et al. (2011, Asset and LiabilityManagement Handbook 
(Palgrave Macmillan, p. 110).

The most imporatnt aspect of the model developed in the project is to incorporate 
the concept of stochastic dominance as a risk measure.
